# Tech_Blogging-Master

Before buying a technology related product, people look at different blogs about it. Also seeing the blog comments and reviews. Then they understand whether buying the product will be right for them or not. If someone blogs a review of something after using it, then others will benefit from seeing that blog later. Technology related products are very sensitive. So, these should be bought after checking well. So, blogging about this type of product is very important for us.
For these reasons, developed the Tech_Blogging-Master using PHP/MySQL. This is a website through which people can get an accurate review (like price, configuration etc.)  for technology related product before buying it. And post their own reviews on any product in the form of a blog. There are many functions working here.
